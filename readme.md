## Relaxato

This is a sandbox for developing a very, very simple "molecular dynamics-like" energy minimizer for 2D islands on surfaes.

To use right now, download two files with the same version number, e.g. v07 and run the one that begins with "test". It will import what it needs from the other file, which will eventually evolve into a proper Pyhon package, unit testing and error messages and all if all goes well.
